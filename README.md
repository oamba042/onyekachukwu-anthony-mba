Senior Cybersecurity Engineer and Security Data Scientist with 10+ years of experience securing
enterprise, cloud, and financial systems.

This GitHub documents how I design, operate, and scale security programs in real-world
environments — from detection engineering and incident response to cloud security architecture
and security analytics.

## Areas of Focus
- Detection Engineering & SOC Operations
- Incident Response & Digital Forensics
- Cloud & Identity Security (Azure, AWS, Microsoft 365)
- Threat Intelligence & Adversary Analysis
- Security Automation & Analytics

## Philosophy
Good security reduces noise, scales with the business, and holds up under stress.
I prioritize signal quality, operational resilience, and decision clarity — especially during incidents.

This repository and the pinned projects reflect how I approach security engineering in production environments.
